    <h2> Ruby Enumerables and Donuts!</h2>
    <p class="text"> Enumerables is a built-in Ruby module which provides us with lots of traversal, search, sorting and manipulation methods. 
        Here we'll be showing the most used methods and a few examples of them in action.
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;each_with_index</h3></summary>
        <p class="text">Calls a block with two arguments, the item and the index for each item. Using each_with_index to assign each name in my array to a desired order of numbers using the index.</p>
        <code>
            names = ["cyndaquil", "quilava", "typhlosion"]
            stages = {}

            names.each_with_index do |item, index|
            stages[item] = index + 1
            end

            # stages => {"cyndaquil"=>1, "quilava"=>2, "typhlosion"=>3}
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;inject</h3></summary>
        <p class="text">Takes a collection and reduces it to a single value using two arguments in a block, the first one is returned after each iteration and the second one is the one used for each iteration, here's how to add up every element in an array.</p>
        <code>
            num_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

            num_array.inject { |sum, num| sum + num }

            # returns => 45
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;select</h3></summary>
        <p class="text">Returns an array containing all elements of enum for which the given block returns a true value. Here we are gonna be checking for strings bigger than or equal to 6.</p>
        <code>
            names = ["Lucas", "Nathan", "Peyton", "Brooke", "Haley"]

            names.select { |name| name.length >= 6 }

            # returns => ["Nathan", "Peyton", "Brooke"]
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;sort_by</h3></summary>
        <p class="text">Sorts enum using a set of keys generated by mapping the values in enum through the given block.</p>
        <code>
            numbers = [10, 1, 1000, 100].sort_by { |num| num.to_s.length }
            #=> [1, 10, 100, 1000]
        </code>

        <p class="text">&nbsp;This example is not very useful in real life, but it's good to demonstrate how to use sort_by.
            We are sorting the numbers based on the number of digits they have. In order to do that we converting each number to string and checking it's length. 
            It's important to notice that this is a temporary convertion, if you want to permanently convert those numbers to strings, we can use map, our next
            enumerable method.
        </p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;map</h3></summary>
        <p>Returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.
        </p>
        <code>
            numbers = [10, 1, 1000, 100].map(&:to_s)
            #=> numbers = ["10", "1", "1000", "100"]
        </code>
        <p class="text"> On this example we are simply converting every element inside the numbers array to a string. Let me give you another example, if you want 
            square numbers, you could do it like this. </p>
        <code>
                number = 5
                (1..number).map { |num| num * num }
                #=> 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
        </code>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><h3>&nbsp;include?(obj)</h3></summary>
        <p class="text"> Returns true if any member of enum equals obj. </p>
        <code>
            names = ["Lucas", "Nathan", "Peyton", "Brooke", "Haley"]

            names.include? "Dan"
            # returns => false
            names.include? "Brooke"
            # returns => true
        </code>
