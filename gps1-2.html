     <li>What is pair programming?</li>
     <p>Pair programming is working together with another person in the same project or program or anything else you want really.
     </p>
     <li>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</li>
     <p>Pair programming is important to DBC because they want to prepare us for the real world and on the real world you pair program a lot.
         There is also empathy and teaching how to be a good teamplayer.

     <li>Compare driver and navigator.</li>
     <p>The driver is the on who is going to be doing most or all of the code,
     focusing on that matter mostly while the navigator will be focusing the whole picture and thinking about the next steps.</p>
     <li>Our experiences so far with pair programming.</li>
     <p>So far pair programming has been a joy because you can count on your partner to help you or maybe guide you and the other way around,
         it helps you connect and improves your teamwork.

        <li>My Reflection</li>
        <p>It was a great pairing session, we managed the time perfectly (finished in exactly 1 hour) and we both could drive and navigate for about the same time. Neither of us struggled during the session and we got the result we expected, we thought of somethings to improve by the end of the session but we were both really satisfied with our work!</p>
