      <p> Good Questions </p>
      <p> How to ask them </p>
      <p> 11/01/2015 </p></span>
      <p> When trying to ask good questions you have to keep some things in mind like making a good title which summarizes the problem and keeps people interested in helping out. A good title is usually concise and specific. You should also watch out for grammar and punctuation mistakes. Since it is a question you are asking, you should structure it as such, not just throw random words related to the problem. </p>
      <p> You should give a decent explanation of the problem before posting any code, and just post code that are pertinent to the specific problem you are having, don't post a lot of random code because this will make people run away from your question. You should also say in which languages and/or APIs your problem is. </p>
      <p> READ your question before you post, check if it makes sense, if it's a question that you would stop to read and answer, make sure you provided everything that's needed to reproduce the problem. These are some helpful guidelines to follow when asking questions. </p>
      <p> After you are convinced you question is good enough, you should post it, but be ready to receive and give feedback on the problem, because usually people will respond to it pretty fast, and if you are not ready they might leave. </p>
