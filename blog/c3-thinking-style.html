			<p> Thinking outside of the box! </p>
			<p> Abstract Thinking. </p>
			<p> 16/11/2014 </p></span>
			<p>Abstract thinkers are capable of conceptualizing and generalizing, they can understand that each concept can mean multiple things. They can use multiple pieces and ideas to create or find a solution. They can... Think outside the box! They thrive in unstructured and people-oriented environments!</p>
			<p>That is... kind of me, but not entirely! I am capable of conceptualizing and generalizing, I understand that concepts can mean multiple things and I can use multiple pieces or ideas to create or find a solution. The final piece is where it goes wrong! I am good in unstructured environments, but I am terrible in people-oriented environments. I never know how to behave until I learn it and get to know the people I'm supposed to be working with.</p>
			<p>I like to discuss my point and their points of view before reaching a decision and acting. I try to apply logic to everything, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't! I thrive learning with guides and milestones, but I can work alone just as well. I love working with friendly people and people I know on a personal level. On the other hand I despise working with rude people and bossy people, even they are my boss I expect respect! I dislike working in environments with lots of strict rules and I am not good sharing my feelings or focusing on one thing, I am always thinking about other stuff while working (Don't get me wrong though! Work related stuff, like how to solve the next problems while still typing the solution to the current one).</p>
			<p>I think my learning and thinking style will fit DBC because they all look like friendly people and they don't seem to have lots of strict rules, they have expectations, that's way different and I can work with that!</p>
			<p>Regarding mindset, I am always changing it depending on the situation. I always try to have a positive attitude and growth mindset, but when the work is overbearing and I can't find a solution for a long time I usually crawl into a ball and think I will never be able to do it if I couldn't do it by then! Hopefully I will be able to change that!</p>
