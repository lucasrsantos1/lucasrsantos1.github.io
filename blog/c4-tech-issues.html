			<p> Can a programmer... program? </p>
			<p> Strategies to find true programmers </p>
			<p> 23/11/2014 </p></span>
			<p> One of the biggest problems in the tech world is the lack of talent and professionals. We have a huge number of job listings and nobody to fill them. Lots of CS majors graduate every year and well... they need jobs! So why is this happening? </p>
			<p> Just because people graduate it doesn't mean they are actually job ready or that they know how to program at all. I read that lots of companies started a pre-interview over skype or an online test to check if they can actually program because they were wasting a lot of time with interviews that were clearly over as soon as they began. </p>
			<p> In my opinion the problem is lack of passion, a lot of greed and bad advertising. We need people who actually enjoy working in tech! I know a lot of people taking CS courses and when asked why they chose this field, unfortunately the most common answer is: "Because I want to be rich". As for bad advertising, we all see the jokes and stereotypes involved with programmers like genius fat people sitting in front of computers all day eating and typing with no social life at all. While some people are like that and actually enjoy being that way, which is perfectly fine, most people would hate this life and/or would think they are not smart enough. We probably have a lot of would-be great programmers who will never even try to code because they are either affraid or demotivated. We need better advertising, support and investment to make it more attractive and accessible to everybody. </p>
			<p> Maybe then we will have more competent professionals and the tech industry will be better! </p>
