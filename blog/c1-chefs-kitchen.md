Squirrels do not order food!

Is anybody else hungry?

Dev Bootcamp is what you make of it! You can't expect to learn just by going there, you have to push yourself and make Dev Bootcamp your home! You have to stay longer, go on weekends, do extra stuff and learn to have fun while doing it.
DBC is a community of motivated and talented people who are hoping for a change in career or just to start a life as a web developer and meet cool people. The teachers are probably just as motivated as the students since the point of the whole thing is to improve and become better which of course they will be doing as well along the way.
I will try my best to succeed, DBC will be my home and the people there will be my family.
We might not always get along, but I will help you succeed and hope for your success!
Thankfully my expectations are still the same, I'm really excited to meet everybody and start having fun (i.e coding) together.
I'm nervous but excited at the same time. I don't really know how well I will fit, but I guess that will be the first challenge on phase 1!
