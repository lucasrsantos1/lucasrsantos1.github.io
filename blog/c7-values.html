			<p> I can and I will! </p>
			<p> Life values and their importance! </p>
			<p> 08/12/2014 </p></span>
			<p> When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, these come to mind:
			Close relationships, Confidence, Coolness under fire, Economic security, Personal development, Reputation, Commitment, Free Time, Privacy, Achievement, Challenge, Decisiveness, Efficiency, Having a Family, Knowledge, Loyalty, Music, Persistence, Pleasure, Romance, Will Power </p>

			<p> In general, I try to live up to these values as follows (Disagree 1 to 5 Agree)</p>
			<p class="br">
				Close relationships - 4
				Confidence - 4
				Coolness under fire - 4
				Economic Security - 5
				Personal Development - 5
				Reputation - 4
				Commitment - 4
				Free Time - 3
				Privacy - 5
				Achievement - 4
				Challenge - 4
				Decisiveness - 3
				Efficiency - 5
				Having a Family - 5
				Knowledge - 5
				Loyalty - 5
				Music - 5
				Persistence - 4
				Pleasure - 5
				Romance - 5
				Will Power - 5 </p>

				<p> To me, the most important value is having a family, I consider my close friends as family and I don't see the point in all the other values if I don't have people to share my happiness with. </p>

				<p> The last time someone asked for my help, it was about databases. A friend of mine is going to college and he asked my help in his database project. I did all I could to help and in the end it felt great being able to help just for the sake of it! </p>

				<p> I like my values, they help me get over most of my personal problems. Whenever I'm feeling down, the first step to get better is listening to some music and then talking to close friends. I usually get over my problems pretty fast this way, my problem is that when I don't get over them fast, I usually bury them and they might become problems again later on. </p>
