      <p> Internal Conflicts. </p>
      <p> How I decided to change my life. </p>
      <p> 04/01/2015 </p></span>
      <p> Conflict is a part of everyone's life and we should learn how to deal with it! When thinking about conflict, the first one that comes to my mind was when deciding to quit my old e-commerce management job to become a systems analyst/programmer (I already landed the job). When I came to talk to my former boss about it, he made some very interesting points about both jobs like growth opportunities, salary, etc. </p>
      <p> Even though he had strong arguments to make me stay, I decided to leave. For a while I had a bad feeling, unsure if I made the right choice, if I was good enough at the moment to work in a big company, what could happen... </p>
      <p> When I was feeling unsure, I started studying more and more so I knew that even if it didn't work out, I was trying hard and that was good enough for me. </p>
      <p> That feeling didn't go away until I realized that I was doing a good job and most importantly, that I was happier at my new job, so it was indeed a good choice. </p>
      <p> Even if I could go back, I wouldn't change my decision. In fact, I would probably quit sooner than I did. After all, I learned that being with people you care about and being happy are way more important than just making money at a job you don't really like.
        Also, if I didn't quit my old job, I probably wouldn't be going to Dev Bootcamp right now! </p>
